Below is a brief description of the columns within each experiment's data folder.

In the data columns of e1_raw.csv, children's responses were sometimes entered in a format other than integers, in an effort to record more qualitatively detailed information about their process (e.g., g is "grabbing", b is "1-by-1"). This was not applied to many children, however, and is re-formatted in the analysis code to correspond to a correct integer interpretation.

Data for Experiment 2 was collected using a browser-based interface, which generated each csv file in the directory apart from consents.csv. The only eventType needed in analyses was "trial". Information from consent forms, containing children's ages, was recorded in consents.csv.
